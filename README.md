## 💡 **Use Cases**  

### 🤖 **AI Agents**  
AI Agents are reshaping Web3, enabling autonomous or assisted transaction execution. Here’s how ARIA can power cutting-edge AI Agent use cases:  

1. **DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)**  
   - Execute recurring transactions automatically.  
   - *Example*: Invest in ETH weekly at a set amount.  

2. **Limit Orders**  
   - Execute transactions when a specified price target is reached.  
   - *Example*: Buy ETH when the price drops to $1,500.  

3. **DeFi Optimizer**  
   - Dynamically allocate investments across DeFi protocols based on custom risk/return preferences.  
   - *Example*: Maximize yield on stablecoins using lending and farming strategies.  

4. **Portfolio Manager**  
   - Balance asset allocation, generate yields, and manage risk by making data-driven investments.  
   - *Example*: Rebalance portfolio monthly to maintain a 70/30 split between stablecoins and volatile assets.
